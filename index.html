                <p>
                    Hello, I’m <strong>Danelly Joseph</strong>, a fourth-year student at Simon Fraser University (SFU), majoring in Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT). 
                    I am currently exploring my passion for web and game design, 3D modeling, and animation, and I’m eager to refine my skills as I progress through my studies. 
                    While I’m still discovering my ideal career path, I’m deeply engaged in design, technology, and digital media—constantly experimenting with 
                    different tools and techniques. This portfolio showcases my latest projects, skills, and creative journey as I continue to grow in the field. I'm always ready to learn 
                    and improve my skills, through the many opportunities offered in my learning career, and give myself a professional title in the field of art and technology.
                </p>

                        <p>
                            In my IAT 167 course, I designed and developed a platformer game in Processing JavaScript titled Trident’s Quest. This project challenged me to apply coding fundamentals and mathematical mechanics to create engaging gameplay. The game follows 
                            the story of a mermaid protagonist whose tail has been stolen by an evil sea queen, drawing inspiration from The Little Mermaid. Players must navigate through levels, collecting the required number of keys to unlock portals and progress further.
                            In the final stage, the ultimate objective is to recover the legendary Trident: a powerful weapon needed to defeat the sea queen and reclaim the mermaid’s tail. This project not only strengthened my programming skills but also gave me valuable
                            experience in designing mechanics, storytelling, and player objectives within the platform genre.

                        <p>
                           In my IAT 344 course, I collaborated with team members Zobia Khalid and Alejandra Hierro to create a short documentary that explores artistic resilience and adaptation through a series of dance sequences. 
                           Filmed at Simon Fraser University’s Vancouver campus in the Contemporary Arts Dance Studio, the project reflects on the relationship between movement, creativity, and the ever-present theme of rain in Vancouver: a poetic symbol 
                           of the city’s dance community. This project deepened my understanding of filmmaking by allowing me to engage with the full production process, including camera work, audio recording, post-editing, and sound design. 
                           beyond technical skills, it also emphasized the importance of collaborative teamwork, communication, and creative vision in producing a cohesive narrative.

                        <p>
                           For my IAT 343 final project: I collaborated with Kirsten Wong, Victoria Lo, Riya Daiya and Riya Wang; to create Quacker’s Quest, a 3D animated film about a mischievous duck causing chaos while stealing oats from a ranger’s kitchen. 
                           The goal was to create a lighthearted film with stylized yet detailed environments, expressive animation, and immersive sound design. I was responsible for designing and building the house exterior, kitchen sink unit, and interior layout, 
                           as well as texturing these assets in Maya Autodesk :a professional 3D software used to create digital content such as 3D models, animations, visual effects, and simulations for media, entertainment, video games, and product design.
