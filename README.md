# Assignment 2: Create a Personal Website
**Due Date:** September 29th, 11:55 PM

## Objective
In this assignment, you will create a personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to build a professional online presence that includes content similar to what you would include in your resume. This website will serve as a portfolio to showcase your skills, education, experience, and interests while helping you get comfortable with front-end web development and version control using GitHub.

## Purpose of the Website:
The Purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase not only my understanding and skill of HTML, CSS and JS SVG (Visualizations)- but also my other projects that I have done in previous courses. 


## The Technologies
The Technologies used to constuct this website is raw HTML and CSS, of course with the help of online resources and tutorials to help me make my website look visually appealing (listed in Summary Doc). Also raw Javascript SVG has been used for the visualization graphs (Pie and ScatterPlot). Only the CreativeSVG of the twinkling stars, had a library involved known as ("https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/svg.js/3.2.0/svg.min.js") SVG.js is released under the MIT License, which is a permissive open-source license. The library has the proper functionality to make the stars twinkle. 


## Navigation 
The website looks very simple. With not much clutter. When you first enter the website, you will see two buttons. One below the headings ("About Me") and one in the upper right corner of the navigation bar. (Visualizations). The Visualizations button lead to the SVG Visualizations graphs in another HTML page called visualizations.html (Once you get to visualizations.html, there will be a button called "Homepage" so you can go back to index.html) The About Me (which is in index.html) button simply scrolls you to the About Me section. And after reading that section-- below it, you will see the Twinkling Creative SVG. Then simply, Scroll past the the Twinkling Creative SVG to see the rest of my portfolio until you hit the footer (where my contact information is).e
